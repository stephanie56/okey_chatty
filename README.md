# Okey Chatty

A minimal chat application built using socket.io.

## Get Started
1. Clone this repo https://github.com/stephanie56/okey_chatty.git
2. Install independencies `npm install`
3. Start local server on port 3000 `node server.js`

## How it Works
- server.js contains codes that run the server receiving socket messages and send back to clients.
- public/client.js contains codes that send messages to the server and receive messages from the server.
